                <b>Hi, Iâ€™m Omer!</b><br></br><br></br>
                Raised in Toronto, Canada, Iâ€™ve had a knack for building things ever since I was a kid. Whether it was tinkering with electronics, coding simple games, or deconstructing gadgets to understand how they worked, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to problem-solving and innovation.            </Typography>


                <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ color: "text.secondary", mb: 2 }}>
                Iâ€™m now a <b>third-year Computer Engineering student</b> at the <b>University of Waterloo</b>, with a deep passion for technology, backend development, and infrastructure. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience through multiple software engineering internships, working on scalable systems, cloud infrastructure, and backend architectures. Currently, Iâ€™m interning at BitGo, where I help build secure, high-performance systems for managing digital assets.            </Typography>

                This website serves as a hub for showcasing my projects and documenting my journey in software development. Beyond coding, Iâ€™m a huge basketball fan and an avid runner. I also enjoy connecting with new people, so feel free to reach outâ€”I'd love to chat. <br></br> <br></br>
                Cheers! ðŸš€
